### Ultra Sonic Communication using HC-SR04 modules
The HC-SR04 modules are made for distance measurement. But they can be used for simple communication also. In this project, we repurpose the HC-SR04 modules to communicate between two Arduino modules. The communication rn is only one directional due to the fact that HC-SR04 wont listen for echo if it wasn't triggered in the first place.
